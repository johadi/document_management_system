# Document Management System
The Document management system is a system that manages documents with types, users and user roles. 
Each document defines access rights; the document defines which roles can access it. Also, each document specifies the date 
it was published. It allows create, retrieve, update and delete actions to be carried out. It also ensures that users are authorized.
